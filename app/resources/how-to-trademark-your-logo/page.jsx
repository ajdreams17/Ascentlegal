        How to Trademark Your Startup Logo: A Step-by-Step Guide
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Imagine launching your startup with a bold new logo—only to discover
        months later that another company is using a nearly identical design.
        That confusion can damage your brand and even spark costly legal
        disputes. Protecting your logo through trademarking gives you exclusive
        rights and safeguards one of your most valuable assets.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Trademarks Matter for Startups</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevent copycats:</strong> Stop competitors from using a
          confusingly similar logo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build recognition:</strong> A distinctive mark helps customers
          trust and remember your business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gain legal protection:</strong> Take action against
          infringers with confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Boost business value:</strong> A registered trademark is an
          asset that grows with your company.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

      <h3>1. Run a Trademark Search</h3>
      <p>
        Search the USPTO database to ensure your logo isn’t already registered.
        A trademark attorney can help uncover potential conflicts.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Create a Distinctive Logo</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid generic icons or stock shapes. The more unique your design, the
        easier it is to protect.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Choose the Right Trademark Class</h3>
      <p>
        Trademarks are categorized by industry. Picking the wrong class can
        weaken or limit your protection.
      </p>

      <h3>4. File Your Application</h3>
      <p>
        Submit through the USPTO with:
        <ul>
          <li>High-quality image of your logo</li>
          <li>Business/owner details</li>
          <li>Description of goods & services</li>
          <li>Correct trademark class</li>
          <li>Filing fee ($350–$550 per class)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>5. Respond to Office Actions</h3>
      <p>
        If the USPTO raises objections, respond quickly to keep your
        application moving forward.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Publication & Opposition</h3>
      <p>
        Your mark is published for 30 days. If unopposed, it proceeds toward
        registration.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Maintain Your Trademark</h3>
      <p>
        File renewals every 5–10 years, actively use the mark in commerce, and
        monitor for infringement.
      </p>

      <h2>Costs & Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>USPTO filing: $350–$550 per class</li>
        <li>Attorney support: $1,000–$2,500</li>
        <li>Timeline: 6 months–1 year</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Trademarking your startup’s logo isn’t just a formality—it’s an
        investment in your brand’s future. With protection in place, you lock in
        exclusive rights, strengthen your reputation, and safeguard long-term
        value.
